# Anvil
## Overview
Anvil is a sumo robot. This repo containts the code of our first iteration
## Hardware
The system was designet to incorporate 2 AVRs: one that would control the motor driver (atmega326) and one that is the main logical controller, responsible for reading the sensors, taking decisions and sending commands to the motor driver.
## Firmware
The system was designed with speed beeing the main feature, so this is the main argument why no arduino code was used. We developed our own customised HAL that would best fit our needs.
